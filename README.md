# TODOs

* Test euclidean distance graph, too. 
* Test edge cases. Empty graph?
* Test graph generation. Perhaps add ability to generate graphs with a set list of weights?
* Is it necessary to test MST in multiple dims? Or can we assume that if all dependencies work in multiple dimensions, MST will too?
* Partial sorting? Eliminating unecessary edges?
